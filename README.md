# Drak'thul Jelita

This is a monorepo for backend and frontend of Drak'thul Jelita

I made this so i can upload screenshots of cool names from WoW that I collected over the years.
Other people can seem them, filter them, etc.

Some other highlights:

- Backend is Laravel API
- Frontend is Vue SPA - I might move it to Inertia and combine it with the backend
- Only admin can upload, edit and delete screenshots
- There is tesseract.js OCR, so you don't have to type out the names when uploading screenshots
- Screenshots are stored in S3
